# Code, Datasets, and Results

Anonymized code accompanying the paper "Can I Still Trust You? Understanding the Impact of Distribution Shifts on Algorithmic Recourses".

The temporal dataset is not included here due to legal considerations (an NDA).

The data preprocessing scripts are included in this repository, but have already been run and do not need to be executed again.

To generate tables 1 through 3, run `bash ./code/generate_tables.sh`, the output gets created in the file `./results/all_tables.csv`.

Plots in Figure 3 are created by running the notebooks `AR-Predictors.ipynb`, `CFE-Targets.ipynb`, `AR-Targets.ipynb`, and `CFE-Predictors.ipynb`.
